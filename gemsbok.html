                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok, or South African oryx (Oryx gazella), is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m at the shoulder. The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm. Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg, while females weigh 100â€“210 kg</p>
                    <p>The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsamma melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required (3 liters per 100 kg bodyweight and day).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok behind the panda canyon and Mo's Pizza.</p>
