                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm with a 172 mm tail and just over 100 g in weight, to the male mandrill, almost 1 m long and weighing up to 36 kg. Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals, including insects and spiders.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
